# Flags Handler

## Idea

In car competitions, expecially in the Formula 1, when a car overtakes the track limits, a yellow flag is showed to the other drivers which are driving in that sector.
In this way the other drivers are forced to slow-down going through that sector.

## Implementation

The system will be composed by two kind of nodes:

- track limit node: this node consists in a sensor that detects a car out of the track limits
- flag node: this node consists in a led that shows the current color of the flag
